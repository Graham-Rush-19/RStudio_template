## About

Update this to provide instructions for the code.

## Set global options

Set the options for the entire document, including the chunk options and clearing the environment. The custom CSS has been used to change the style of the tables and other features in the document. See the [cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/rmarkdown.html) for help. 

```{r include = FALSE}
# set the chunks
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE,
  results = 'hide',
  echo = FALSE,
  include = FALSE
)
# Clear the environment
rm(list = ls())
```

## Load the packages required

Add any packages to the `packages` object. Add `include=FALSE` to remove the code from the report

```{r, load_functions} 
packages <- c('clipr', 'ARTofR')

for (package in packages) {
  if (!require(package, character.only = TRUE)) {
    message(paste("Installing package:", package))
    install.packages(package, dependencies = TRUE) # Install if not available
    library(package, character.only = TRUE)        # Load after installation
  } else {
    message(paste("Loaded package:", package))
  }
}
```
## Sourcing external R Files

The files should be saved in the `R` file. See https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/source-script.html for information

```{r, load-multiple-scripts}
# # 1. List only the scripts you want (just the filenames, no path)
# selected <- c("script1.R", "script2.R", "script3.R")
# 
# # 2. Set the folder so we get "R/script1.R", etc.
# scripts <- file.path("R", selected)
# 
# # 3. Source each one into your knit environment
# for (f in scripts) {
#   source(f, local = knitr::knit_global())
# }
```

# Limitations

You may notice that this kind of template requires the external files to be in the same working directory as the R Markdown file. This can make the file less portable, and also can become frustrating if you want to have lots of additional files.

You may overcome this limitation by creating a custom R Markdown format. This allows us to reference to files contained directly within your custom template package. To see an example of this, check out template 5.
